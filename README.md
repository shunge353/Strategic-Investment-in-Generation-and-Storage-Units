# Strategic-Investment-in-Generation-and-Storage-Units
This script is an implemention of a naive centralized and/or bilevel generation expansion problem based on the paper [Applications of Bilevel Optimization in Energy and Electricity Markets](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-52119-6_5).

A [GAMS source code](https://github.com/datejada/SIGASUS) is available by the Diego A. Tejada-Arango. This is just a transformation of GAMS code into a MATLAB one

Requirement: installing of modeling language [YALMIP](https://yalmip.github.io/) and a MIP solver such as [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/)
